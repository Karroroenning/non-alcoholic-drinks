# NonAlco4Me

NonAlco4Me is a website that you can find many different non-alcoholic drink recipes. There are lots of different flavors and combinations. Maybe you want something fruity and sweet or why not a good lemon and tonic.

You can comment on recipes if you want to give feedback to the creator or if you simply want to add something to the recipe to help others bring out a little touch of different flavor in the drink. You can like recipes aswell but also add your own recipes if you are registered on the website.

NonAlco4Me has been built using the Django Framework in Python, HTML and CSS. It provides user authentication and full CRUD functionality.

### Color Scheme
<img src="documentation/images/nonalco4me.png" >

I want the colors to give a calming and modern feeling. I have chosen to have a light background so that there will be a good contrast between the important thing that should be seen the most and the background. It must not flow together because it can be perceived as disturbing to the eye. 

### Typography:

All fonts were obtained from the Google Fonts library. I have chosen the same font throughout the web page. A simple typeface that does very well with the rest.

Font: Lato

### Imagery:

- For the first page, I want an image that shows what the page has to offer. The color in the picture is very appropriate with the colors I have on the rest of the website.
<details><summary>Hero Image</summary>
<img src="documentation/images/pexels-taryn-elliott-4144243_copy.jpg" >
</details>

<br>


- For the placeholder image (if a user does not upload their own image when submitting a recipes). I chose this image because it matches the hero image. Although there is a different drink in the picture. You want everything to fit together.
<details><summary>Placeholder image</summary>
<img src="documentation/images/pexels-taryn-elliott-4457151_copy1.jpg" >
</details>

<br>
- All other images present on the site will be chosen by users. The admin can change or remove images that are inappropriate, before approving and publishing reviews to the main site.
